Clones, or avatars, are copies of the playerâ€™s body.

They are grown in a Dwemer Cloning Tube, which has a compartment for power infused gems.

These gems can act like a constant effect, whenever the clone is active, the effects are active.

There is a limit on how many gems can be active, this limit can be raised a little amount by progression.

In order to control the clones, the player must be held in a tube similar to a dwemer cloning tube, that transmits their consciousness to the clone, so that they can take direct control of the clone.

Later on, the player can have the ability to control multiple clones at once. They cannot be talked to, but can follow the player around, and help them in combat. You may also be able to hotswap between them. This may be useful in certain puzzles.

When the clone dies, the game does not end, but that clone is now dead, along with any power gems it was using. The player is reverted to their own body, or the last clone they inhabited that is still alive. The equipment stays on that clone, and must be retrieved if the player wishes to recover it.
