Clones of the player can be created. They take the form of NPCs. In MWSE, there will be a record per race and gender, which is then renamed, and has new faces/hair set on creation. In OpenMW, the record can be overridden, so only one is needed.

A list of created clones is stored in a lua table, along with the save game.

The player is teleported and swapped with these NPCs when they wish to "take control". Their inventories are swapped, and their positions.
