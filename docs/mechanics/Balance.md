Creating clones should be something that improves with the player's skill or quest level.

You should be required to provide a certain amount of material to create a new clone/avatar. Conjuration may be used, to get flesh from a artifact obtained by a quest. But there should still be an item required per clone.



Intially, the clones will not have special abilities, and may have random curses permenantly applied.

Effects applied to the player, such as birthsigns and the corpus cure, may not be preserved. 

Vampirism should be preserved.
