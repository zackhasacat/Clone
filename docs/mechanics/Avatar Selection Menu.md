The avatar menu can be opened(at any time? Or just at a tube or while inside of a clone) to display a list of all clones/avatars the player can control, as well as their original body.

The menu will have a list on the left of all the avatars, with details on their location, current condition(health etc), tier(maybe?), and encumburance.

On the right side of the menu will be a menu detailing the selected avatar. It can show their inventory, equipment, and on MWSE, maybe a character doll of them.

It will list the enhancements and curses active on the clone.
