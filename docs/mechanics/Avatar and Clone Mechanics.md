Clones of the player can be created. They take the form of NPCs. In MWSE, and OpenMW(Once possible) the record for the NPC will be overridden with the player's race, head, hair, and gender.

A list of created clones is stored in a lua table, along with the save game.

The player is teleported and swapped with these NPCs when they wish to "take control". Their inventories are swapped, and their positions.
